# The story element

The story element has to be the root element of any script in BSML. Attributes given to it will apply to the entire scripts and can be consumed as usual.

Example:

```xml
<story>
	<!-- your story here -->
</story>
```

It is an error for the root element to be called something different than `story` and it is an error to have multiple or no root element.
